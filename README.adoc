Project smile is a premier project designed by the esteemed students of F07, There is only one goal of this project, to let your imaginations run wild. Project smile was inspired by Jonathan our class chairman who has always helped the class to submit homework. In the spirit of automation to take peopleâ€™s jobs away and achieve the singularity, we wanted to create an autonomous robot that could submit our homeworks for us. 

Project smile lives by the concept that every idea is a good idea. We will be incorporating all aspects of engineering epd, istd, dai, esd and asd into our car, if it can fly even better. However, as much as we treasure the pursuit of knowledge, what we treasure even more is the pursuit of happiness therefore the name project smile. components of the vehicle discussed include a flamethrower, a super long robotic arm that can press lifts, a super loud speaker that can blast music to spur the festive spirit, a missile launcher that can shoot out fruit plus and other goodies into the air, mounting a $4000 telescope on top to do SpaceX missions, an in built holographic system which shows Alif dancing and a parachute so it can drive off the upper levels and land safely on level one. As such, we decided to design a modular system for our vehicle such that we can easily attach and detach new mechanisms unto our system. 

As part of phase 1 of project smile, we will be designing the base chassis for our vehicle with a two wheel drive with a special steering design which will be created by our car design expert Bryan who is also part of the premium electric vehicle club in SUTD. We will be using the phone as our main sensor and through web RTC, we will be creating the real time video communication with our laptops or phones so that we can control the vehicle remotely from our room and drive around school. As a further extension, our AI expert Alif will be creating cool AI solutions and use computer vision and object detection to detect obstacles and people. Kevin and Sanat will be in charge of dealing with the app design and Pin is the yes, also known as the project manager for project smile. 

With any great venture, there will undoubtedly be great trials and tribulations, but it is the true spirit of creating a better world by design that will spur us on. It is also this passion that has banded us  vagabonds together to create a better future, a future where humans have become obsolete with the rise of robots and automation. Let us create the MIT SUTD was meant to be.
